# About Me

I am a **BBA LLB (Hons)** student at **SASTRA Deemed University (Batch of 2025)**.  
Passionate about **corporate law, IPR, taxation, and insolvency**, I seek to contribute through research, litigation, and advisory roles.  
My interests also extend to **academic writing and mooting**, where I have earned recognition at the national level.
